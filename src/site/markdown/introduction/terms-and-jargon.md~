# Rose machine

The **RoSe Machine** is the core concept of RoSe. A machine allows you to import local OSGi services via different protocol (e.g web-services, http, json-rpc) and to create proxies in the OSGi broker for available remote services.

This machine represents all informations about the service to be imported or exporter, e.g. filter, factories, host, id and the type of machine (export or import)

# Endpoint

Is a detached entity where the the client finds all the informations about a service, informations like where such service is hosted, the list of interfaces that are provided by this service, list of its properties, _etc_.

The EndPoint is part of OSGi specification and can be found in the **remote service admin** section, or [here](http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v42/org/osgi/service/remoteserviceadmin/EndpointDescription.html).

# Border controllers: importers and exporters

Importers and Exported are responsible for the transite of services from or to **OSGi Platform**. **Importers** bring services from outside of the platform to the **OSGi Platform**, and the **Exporters** do in opposite direction.

## Importer


## Exporter

# Discovery

Discovery is the fashion how we find out that something is available, for instance you can use _RSS feed_ as a discovery for news, when you receive a new paper headline in you _feed_ means that you have a news, so you just discovered a news.
